Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Rising global temperatures are causing extreme weather events, melting polar ice caps, and threatening biodiversity. Scientists attribute much of this warming to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels. Governments and organizations worldwide are taking steps to reduce carbon emissions and promote renewable energy sources. However, many argue that these efforts are not enough and that more drastic measures are needed to prevent catastrophic environmental damage. The debate continues on how to balance economic growth with environmental protection, and what role individuals can play in combating climate change.
